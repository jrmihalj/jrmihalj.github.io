### Research Overview
Research in our lab integrates across disciplines to understand the dominant drivers of pathogen transmission in wildlife systems. While we are strongly grounded in epidemiological theory, we also develop statistical computing techniques to rigorously link our models with data from the lab and from the field. In our work, we seek to constantly motivate our field work and modeling with real-world issues of conservation, disease control, and pest control.

### Diversity Statement
Our lab is committed to supporting the growth of young scientists from diverse backgrounds, especially those with underrepresented ethnic, racial, economic, gender, religious, and sexual orientation identities. We believe that our science and our society are improved by recognizing and fostering diverse perspectives.
