# Welcome to my site!

My research lies at the intersection of quantitative, community, and disease ecology. I apply a variety of mathematical, statistical and empirical methods to discover the ecological and epidemiological drivers of host-pathogen community composition, ultimately informing infectious disease dynamics. 

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicago, working with [Greg Dwyer](dwyerlab.uchicago.edu) and our US Forest Service collaborator, [Karl Polivka](http://www.fs.fed.us/research/people/profile.php?alias=kpolivka). We are studying the epizootic dynamics Douglas-fir tussock moth baculoviruses in the Pacific Northwest. Our goal is to integrate experiments and mechanistic modeling approaches to develop recommendations for a USFS microbial control program and to generally gain a deeper understanding of the host-pathogen biology in this system. This project neatly demonstrates how mathematical epidemiology can inform a practical problem: biological pest control. You can read about this project more informally at this [blog](http://www.numbatmedia.com/stories/2016/4/5/mihaljevic?platform=hootsuite).

Before coming to Greg's lab, I received my PhD in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology from the University of Colorado-Boulder, where I worked with [Piet Johnson](www.colorado.edu/eeb/facultysites/pieter/). For my dissertation, I studied how host and pathogen diversity affect transmission dynamics using theory and an amphibian-virus system of conservation concern. Additionally, in an effort to understand broader scale patterns of pathogen diversity, I began applying the metacommunity framework to host-symbiont systems, which I plan to continue to develop with theory and empirical approaches. 

In addition to basic research, I am also interested in creating outreach materials related to biology and, in particular, statistics and other quantitative methods. I am a proponent of strong data management, reproducible analysis, and unbiased visualization, and I am developing curriculum to teach these useful skills to young biologists. You can see some sample material on my Blog.
