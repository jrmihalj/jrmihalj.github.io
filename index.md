### Research Overview
Dr. Mihaljevic is an Assistant Professor at Northern Arizona University's School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems (SICCS), and he is an affiliate researcher at NAU's Pathogen and Microbiome Institute. Research in our lab integrates across disciplines to understand the dominant drivers of pathogen transmission in wildlife systems. While we are strongly grounded in epidemiological theory, we also develop statistical computing techniques to rigorously link our models with data that we collect from the lab and from the field. We seek to constantly motivate our field work and modeling with real-world issues of conservation, disease control, and pest control.

### Diversity in STEM Fields
Our lab is committed to supporting the growth of student scientists from diverse and historicaly underrepresented groups in the STEM fields, including those who identify as ethnic, racial, economic, religious and gender minorities, and those from the [LGBTQ+ community](https://www.500queerscientists.com/){:target="_blank"}. We believe that our science and our society are improved by recognizing and fostering diverse perspectives.
