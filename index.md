# Welcome to my site!

My research lies at the intersection of community and disease ecology. I apply a variety of mathematical, statistical and empirical methods to discover the ecological and epidemiological drivers of host-pathogen community composition, with the ultimate goal of informing infectious disease dynamics. 

I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Chicago, working with [Greg Dwyer](http://dwyerlab.uchicago.edu){:target="_blank"} and our US Forest Service collaborator, [Karl Polivka](http://www.fs.fed.us/research/people/profile.php?alias=kpolivka){:target="_blank"}. We are studying the epizootic dynamics of Douglas-fir tussock moth baculoviruses in the Pacific Northwest. Our aim is to integrate experiments and mechanistic modeling approaches to develop insights for a USFS microbial control program and to generally gain a deeper understanding of the biology in this host-pathogen system. This project neatly demonstrates how mathematical epidemiology can inform a practical problem: biological pest control. You can read about this project - more informally - at this [blog](http://www.numbatmedia.com/stories/2016/4/5/mihaljevic?platform=hootsuite){:target="_blank"}.

Before coming to Greg's lab, I received my PhD in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology from the University of Colorado-Boulder, where I worked with [Piet Johnson](http://www.colorado.edu/eeb/facultysites/pieter/){:target="_blank"}. For my dissertation, I studied how host and pathogen diversity affect transmission dynamics using theory and an amphibian-virus system of conservation concern. In an effort to understand broader scale patterns of pathogen diversity, I also applied the metacommunity framework to host-symbiont systems, which I continue to develop with theory and empirical approaches.

In addition to basic research, I am also interested in creating outreach and teaching materials related to biology and, in particular, statistics and other quantitative methods. I am a proponent of strong data management, reproducible analysis, and unbiased visualization, and I am developing curricula to teach these useful skills to young biologists. You can see some sample material on my [Blog](/blog/){:target="_blank"}.
