### Research Overview
Dr. Mihaljevic is an Assistant Professor at Northern Arizona University's School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems (SICCS), and he is an affiliate researcher at NAU's Pathogen and Microbiome Institute. Research in our lab integrates across disciplines to understand the dominant drivers of pathogen transmission. While we are strongly grounded in epidemiological theory, we also develop statistical computing techniques to rigorously link our models with data that we collect from the lab, from the field, and from previously published research. We seek to constantly motivate our field work and modeling with real-world issues of wildlife conservation, public health, and pest control.

#### COVID-19 Research

We have been working in collaboration with Arizona Dept. of Health Services to produce short-term, county-level projections of hospital capacity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This work has been funded by the National Science Foundation and the Flinn Foundation.

Although much of this work is for internal planning purposes, and we are offering this as part of our public health advisory service, we still want to communicate our methods for generating these projections. In light of this, we have produced an *R* package that allows for rapid simulations of spatially-explicit, stochastic models of disease transmission, including a SARS-CoV-2-specific modeling framework. Importantly, our package allows users the ability to simulate custom time-windows of non-pharmaceutical interventions via altering specific parameters over time. $\texttt{SPARSEMODr v1.0}$ is now on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SPARSEMODr){:target="_blank"} with several vignettes, and we are interested in getting volunteers to test our package. Reach out to Dr. Mihaljevic for details. Our package source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/NAU-CCL/SPARSEMODr){:target="_blank"} and the vignettes are compiled on our [website](http://sparsemod.nau.edu/rpkg/){:target="_blank"}. 

### Diversity in STEM Fields
Our lab is committed to supporting the growth of student scientists from diverse and historically underrepresented groups in the STEM fields, including those who identify as ethnic, racial, economic, religious and gender minorities, and those from the [LGBTQ+ community](https://www.500queerscientists.com/){:target="_blank"}. We believe that our science and our society are improved by recognizing and fostering diverse perspectives.
