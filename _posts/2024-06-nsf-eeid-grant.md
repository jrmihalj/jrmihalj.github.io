## New NSF EEID Grant Awarded

We received a 5-year NSF Ecology & Evolution of Infectious Disease (EEID) grant to study the effects of climate on two viral pathogens of marine fish. We will be using the Pacific herring study system, conducting field work and experiments, and building models to address fundamental questions in host-pathogen interactions and climate-disease biology.
