## New NIH Grant Awarded

We received a 5-year grant, which is a Research Project within the NIH U54, Southwest Health Equity Research Collaborative, with Dr. Julie Baldwin as the PI. Dr. Mihaljevic will be the Lead Investigator on a project within this grant to develop statistical techniques that will better integrate social determinants of health into mathematical models of infectious disease transmission.
