Over the last decade, empirical and theoretical work has determined that host community composition affects the transmission of generalist pathogens, often in nuanced ways that can be specific to different systems. At the same time, the pathogen community composition within and among hosts can influence pathogen replication and host survival rates, thereby affecting transmission. Thus, a major avenue of future research is to determine the concominant affects of host and pathogen community composition in real wildlife disease systems.

In my thesis work, I began exploring these questions both theoretically and empirically. First, my collaborators and I parameterized a multi-host, mechanistic disease model using principles from community ecology and allometric scaling to better understand the role of local host community composition on the transmission of a generalist pathogen ([Mihaljevic et al. 2014](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9UsfqlH3_y1ZDlBTzFwelhqblk)). Specifically, we wanted to know how relationships between host community species richness and total community density/abundance could influence the scaling of transmission and richness. One interesting finding is that when host community density saturates with richness (i.e. as you add species, total community density asymptotes), non-monotonic relationships between richness and transmission emerge for pathogens with density-dependent transmission. ![Theory1](/images/research/theory1.jpg). I am currently working with collaborators to extend this model to include multiple pathogen species and a spatially explicit structure, allowing for host movement.
