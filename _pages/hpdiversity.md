# Host and Pathogen Community Dynamics

Over the last decade, empirical and theoretical work has determined that host community composition affects the transmission of generalist pathogens, often in nuanced ways that can be specific to different systems. At the same time, the pathogen community composition within and among hosts can influence pathogen replication and host survival rates, thereby affecting transmission. Thus, a major avenue of future research is to determine the concominant affects of host and pathogen community composition in real wildlife disease systems.

## Theory
In my thesis work, I began exploring these questions both theoretically and empirically. First, my collaborators and I parameterized a multi-host, mechanistic disease model using principles from community ecology and allometric scaling to better understand the role of local host community composition on the transmission of a generalist pathogen ([Mihaljevic et al. 2014](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9UsfqlH3_y1ZDlBTzFwelhqblk)). Specifically, we wanted to know how relationships between host community species richness and total community density/abundance could influence the scaling of transmission and richness. One interesting finding is that when host community density saturates with richness (i.e. as you add species, total community density asymptotes), non-monotonic relationships between richness and transmission emerge for pathogens with density-dependent transmission. ![Theory1](/images/research/theory1.jpg). 

I am currently working with collaborators to extend this model to include multiple pathogen species and a spatially explicit structure, allowing for host movement. 

## Amphibian Ranaviruses
I also explored the effects of pathogen diversity on host health and transmission using an amphibian-virus system of conservation concern. Viruses of the genus *Ranavirus* infect hundreds of amphibian species globally and can cause large, local die-off events as a result of highly transmissible, systemic infections that cause severe hemorrhages and organ failure. ![Ranavirus1](/images/research/ranavirus1.jpg) These viruses are ecologically and genetically diverse, globally widespread, locally prevalent, which makes them a great system to explore questions about how pathogen and host diversity affect disease. Collaborators and I conducted a lab experiment to understand how the two type-species of this viral genus might interact to affect overall transmission and disease (Mihaljevic et at. *in revision*). We found that co-exposure to two *Ranavirus* species, but not to two strains of the same species, leads to increased susceptibility, enhanced virual replication, and in some cases larger epidemics. In the future, I will combine widespread pathogen and host surveys, experiments and mechanistic models to better understand the epidemiological consequences of host and pathogen diversity in this system.
