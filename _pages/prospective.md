## Prospective Scientists

We are currently recruiting undergraduate and graduate students whose interests include epidemiological modeling, field and laboratory studies on wildlife diseases, and those interested in bioinformatics of pathogen commmunities. Graduate students would join the new and exciting PhD program in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems, which offers a unique, rigorous, and multi-disciplinary curriculum. PI Mihaljevic is also affiliated with NAU's Pathogen and Microbiome Institue (PMI), which offers state of the art molecular tools for studying disease. Students would ideally be comfortable in the field, while also having a passion for learning the most current quantitative tools available to ecologists. 

Interested students are encouraged to contact PI Mihaljevic directly, stating their research interests and providing some information about their background.

We are also happy to coordinate with interested post-doctoral candidates who wish to submit grant proposals in complementary fields.
