## Prospective Research Staff

We are recruiting to support a recently awarded NIH grant, with up to five years of funding:
- [Lead Systems Software Engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3278408345/?alternateChannel=search&refId=cIb1JH89jWZuR%2FUVrQvO4A%3D%3D&trackingId=2Cq6rsebIOaJazuZyndwsA%3D%3D){:target="_blank"}

This position will support our recent [NIH-funded project](https://jrmihalj.github.io/nih-grant/){:target="_blank"} that is focused on understanding the ways in which spatial epidemiological models can be better deployed to support public health decision-making. The project will develop theory, build software (called EpiMoRPH â€“ Epidemiological Modeling Resources for Public Health), and coordinate with diverse stakeholders in academia, public health, and industry. 

Start date is flexible, but ideally the candidates would start soon.

Please reach out to Dr. Mihaljevic with questions. 

## Prospective Graduate and Undergraduate Students

We are currently recruiting undergraduate and graduate students (MS or PhD) whose interests include computer science, epidemiological modeling, and wildlife diseases. Graduate students would join the Informatics PhD program in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems, which offers a unique, rigorous, and multi-disciplinary curriculum. PI Mihaljevic is also affiliated with NAU's Pathogen and Microbiome Institue (PMI), which offers state of the art molecular tools for studying disease.
