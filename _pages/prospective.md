You will need to go to the [NAU Careers](https://in.nau.edu/human-resources/employment-application-instructions/){:target="_blank"} page and create an account to formally apply, but feel free to reach out to Dr. Mihaljevic over email for additional information.


We are also happy to coordinate with interested post-doctoral candidates who wish to submit grant proposals in complementary fields, as well. 

## Prospective Graduate and Undergraduates

We are currently recruiting undergraduate and graduate students (MS or PhD) whose interests include epidemiological modeling, field and laboratory studies of wildlife diseases, and those interested in bioinformatics of pathogen commmunities. Graduate students would join the Informatics PhD program in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems, which offers a unique, rigorous, and multi-disciplinary curriculum. PI Mihaljevic is also affiliated with NAU's Pathogen and Microbiome Institue (PMI), which offers state of the art molecular tools for studying disease. Students would ideally be comfortable in the field, while also having a passion for learning the most current quantitative tools available to ecologists. 

Interested students are encouraged to contact PI Mihaljevic directly, stating their research interests and providing some information about their background.
