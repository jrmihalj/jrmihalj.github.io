## Prospective Graduate and Undergraduate Students

We are currently recruiting undergraduate and graduate students (MS or PhD) whose interests include computer science, epidemiological modeling, and wildlife diseases. Graduate students would join the Informatics PhD program in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems, which offers a unique, rigorous, and multi-disciplinary curriculum. PI Mihaljevic is also affiliated with NAU's Pathogen and Microbiome Institue (PMI), which offers state of the art molecular tools for studying disease. 

Interested students are encouraged to contact Dr. Mihaljevic directly, stating their research interests and providing some information about their background.
