## Prospective Research Staff

We are recruiting two positions to support a recently awarded NIH grant, with up to five years of funding:
- [Research Software Engineer](https://careers.insidehighered.com/job/2535483/research-software-engineer/){:target="_blank"}
- [Postdoctoral Scholar](https://careers.insidehighered.com/job/2552265/postdoctoral-scholar-mihaljevic-lab/){:target="_blank"}

These positions will support our recent [NIH-funded project](https://jrmihalj.github.io/nih-grant/){:target="_blank"} that is focused on understanding the ways in which spatial epidemiological models can be better deployed to support public health decision-making. The project will develop theory, build software (called EpiMoRPH â€“ Epidemiological Modeling Resources for Public Health), and coordinate with diverse stakeholders in academia, public health, and industry. 

The staff members will work closely in collaboration with Dr. Mihaljevic and Dr. Eck Doerry (Computer Science) at NAU. The chosen candidates can also develop collaborations with researchers in the Pathogen and Microbiome Institute and the Center for Health Equity Research at NAU, and with other collaborators at Arizona State University, University of Nebraska at Lincoln, and Northwestern University.

Start date is flexible, but ideally the candidates would start soon. 

To apply, please go to [NAU Careers](https://in.nau.edu/human-resources/current-job-openings/){:target="_blank"} > Staff Openings > Search for "Mihaljevic" to pull up the open positions. You will need to create a profile to apply. 

Please reach out to Dr. Mihaljevic with questions. 

## Prospective Graduate and Undergraduate Students

We are currently recruiting undergraduate and graduate students (MS or PhD) whose interests include computer science, epidemiological modeling, and wildlife diseases. Graduate students would join the Informatics PhD program in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems, which offers a unique, rigorous, and multi-disciplinary curriculum. PI Mihaljevic is also affiliated with NAU's Pathogen and Microbiome Institue (PMI), which offers state of the art molecular tools for studying disease. 

Interested students are encouraged to contact Dr. Mihaljevic directly, stating their research interests and providing some information about their background.
