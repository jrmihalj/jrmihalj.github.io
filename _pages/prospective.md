## Postdoctoral Scholars (updated June 2024)

We are not currently recruiting Postdoctoral Scholars onto our projects. 
However, any Postdoctoral candidates who are interested in writing fellowship proposals together can definitely reach out to Dr. Mihaljevic.


## Prospective Graduate and Undergraduate Students

Although we are not actively recruiting undergraduate and graduate students (MS or PhD), those whose interests include computer science, epidemiological modeling, and wildlife diseases can write an expression of interest to Dr. Mihaljevic. 
Graduate students would join the Informatics PhD program in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems, which offers a unique, rigorous, and multi-disciplinary curriculum. PI Mihaljevic is also affiliated with NAU's Pathogen and Microbiome Institue (PMI), which offers state of the art molecular tools for studying disease. 

Interested students are encouraged to contact Dr. Mihaljevic directly, stating their research interests and providing some information about their background.
