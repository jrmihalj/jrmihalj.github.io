## Hiring: Postdoctoral Scholar (updated May 2023)

We are recruiting a Postdoctoral Scholar to support a recently awarded NIH grant, with up to five years of funding.

This position will support our recent [NIH-funded project](https://jrmihalj.github.io/nih-sherc-grant/){:target="_blank"}. The project will develop mathematical and statistical techniques to better identify how social determinants of health and mobility patterns influence the transmission of infectious disease and disease outcomes. Further, this information will help us to develop better frameworks of modeling diseases in meta-populations while accounting for environmental factors, such as social determinants of health.

Start date is flexible, but ideally the candidates would start soon. 

To apply, please go to [NAU Careers](https://in.nau.edu/human-resources/current-job-openings/){:target="_blank"} > Current Openings > Search for "607206" to pull up the open position. You will need to create a profile to apply. 

Please reach out to Dr. Mihaljevic with questions. 

## Prospective Graduate and Undergraduate Students

We are currently recruiting undergraduate and graduate students (MS or PhD) whose interests include computer science, epidemiological modeling, and wildlife diseases. Graduate students would join the Informatics PhD program in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems, which offers a unique, rigorous, and multi-disciplinary curriculum. PI Mihaljevic is also affiliated with NAU's Pathogen and Microbiome Institue (PMI), which offers state of the art molecular tools for studying disease. 

Interested students are encouraged to contact Dr. Mihaljevic directly, stating their research interests and providing some information about their background.
